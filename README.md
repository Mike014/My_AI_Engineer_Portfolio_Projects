# Overview 

This repository presents some Machine Learning concepts acquired from my **AI Engineering Professional Certificate specialization course**.

## Create a virtual environment with **Conda**:
 ```bash
 conda create -n ml_env python=3.12
 conda activate ml_env
```

### Glossary of Terms Used in the Course

1. **Algorithm**: A set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or making a prediction in machine learning.
2. **Bias**: Systematic error introduced by the model when it fails to capture the complexity of the data, leading to underfitting.
3. **Churn Prediction**: The process of predicting whether a customer will abandon a service or subscription.
4. **Classes**: The possible outcomes or output categories predicted by the model.
5. **Classification**: Classification predicts which category a piece of data belongs to by assigning it a discrete label.
6. **Features**: The input (independent) variables that describe the observations.
7. **Inference**: Refers to the process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data. It is where the model, based on patterns learned during training, provides output for inputs that have never been seen before.
8. **Labeled Data**: Input data that includes the correct answer (label or class) for training.
9. **MSE**: Measures how close the target values at a node are to the mean.
10. **Overfitting**: Where the model learns specific details and noise from the training data, but fails to generalize to new data.
11. **Regression**: Regression is a statistical technique that estimates a relationship between a continuous dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
12. **Supervised Learning**: Definition: A learning method in which the model is trained on labeled data (with known features and targets).
13. **Target**: The dependent or output variable that the model is intended to predict.
14. **Underfitting**: Occurs when a machine learning model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data.
15. **Unsupervised Learning**: Definition: A learning method in which the model works on unlabeled data, looking for patterns or structures in the data.
