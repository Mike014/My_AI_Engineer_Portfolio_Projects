## **What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of simulating aspects of human intelligence. This includes activities such as learning, reasoning, perception, language comprehension, and problem-solving.

AI is based on algorithms and mathematical models that allow machines to **analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions** autonomously or with human assistance.

## **1. Types of Artificial Intelligence**
AI can be divided into **three main categories** based on the level of autonomy and reasoning capability.

### **A. Weak AI (Narrow AI)**
This is the current form of AI, designed to perform **specific tasks**. It does not have general intelligence like a human.
- **Examples**: Voice assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation engines (Netflix, Spotify), chatbots, facial recognition.

### **B. Strong AI (General AI)**
A hypothetical AI that would be capable of **thinking and learning like a human** autonomously.
