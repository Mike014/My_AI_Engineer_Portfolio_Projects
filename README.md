# Overview 

This repository presents some Machine Learning concepts acquired from my **AI Engineering Professional Certificate specialization course**.

## Create a virtual environment with **Conda**:
 ```bash
 conda create -n ml_env python=3.12
 conda activate ml_env
```

### Glossary of Terms Used in the Course

1. **Algorithm**: A set of step-by-step instructions for solving a problem or making a prediction in machine learning.
2. **Bias**: Systematic error introduced by the model when it fails to capture the complexity of the data, leading to underfitting.
3. **Churn Prediction**: The process of predicting whether a customer will abandon a service or subscription.
4. **Classes**: The possible outcomes or output categories predicted by the model
5. **Labeled Data**: Input data that includes the correct answer (label or class) for training.
6. **Features**: The input (independent) variables that describe the observations.
7. **Supervised Learning**: Definition: A learning method in which the model is trained on labeled data (with known features and targets).
8. **Unsupervised Learning**: Definition: A learning method in which the model works on unlabeled data, looking for patterns or structures in the data.
