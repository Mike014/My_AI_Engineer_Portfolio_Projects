## **What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?**
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of simulating aspects of human intelligence. This includes activities such as learning, reasoning, perception, language comprehension, and problem-solving.

AI is based on algorithms and mathematical models that allow machines to **analyze data, recognize patterns, and make decisions** autonomously or with human assistance.
