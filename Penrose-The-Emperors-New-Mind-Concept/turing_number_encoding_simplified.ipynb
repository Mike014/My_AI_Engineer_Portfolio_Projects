    "# **Encoding Numbers on a Turing Machine, Without Going Crazy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Why unary is a problem**\n",
    "* In **unary**, the number 7 is written as `1111111`.\n",
    "* It's easy for the machine, but if the number is large the tape becomes extremely long: **very slow** and **bulky**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Let's move to binary... but we need a trick**\n",
    "* In **binary**, 7 is `111`, 13 is `1101`, etc. Much more **compact**.\n",
    "* But on the Turing tape there are infinite `0`s to the right (the \"blank\" tape). How do I understand **where the number ends** and **where the empty zeros begin**?\n",
    "* And if I want to write **multiple numbers in a row** (like \"5, 13, 0, 1, 1, 4\")? The `0`s inside the numbers get confused with the `0`s between one number and another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) The trick: \"expanded binary\" (intuitive version)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine placing a **special bookmark** (\"comma\") between one binary number and another that doesn't get confused with the `0`s and `1`s of the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is:\n",
    "* We use `2` as a **comma** (separator between numbers).\n",
    "* The blocks of `0` and `1` **between** these commas are the actual binary numbers.\n",
    "* If desired, larger symbols (`3`, `4`, â€¦) can represent **instructions** (\"plus\", \"times\", \"repeat\", etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice: instead of writing only `0` and `1` in a row without breathing room, we **unpack** the sequence with **markers** that say \"here one number ends, here the next one starts\".\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ Result: now the machine knows where a number ends, can put **multiple numbers** one after another and even mix **numbers and instructions** without ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Useful note about zero**\n",
    "* In binary notation, leading zeros don't count (like `00101` is `101`).\n",
    "* For **zero** between two commas we can even write **two commas in a row**: `,,` = \"there's a zero here\". It's just a short way to say \"number zero\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Super simple example**\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to encode: **5, 13, 0, 1**\n",
    "* In binary: `5 = 101`, `13 = 1101`, `0 = 0`, `1 = 1`.\n",
    "* I separate them with **commas** (`2`) so the machine clearly distinguishes them: `101 , 1101 , 0 , 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now on the tape I know **where** to read each number, without confusing them with the blank zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Why it's convenient**\n",
    "* For large numbers, **expanded binary** is **much more compact** than unary (you save tape and time).\n",
    "* It's also **more expressive**: besides numbers, you can insert **instructions** like \"add\", \"multiply\", \"repeat N times\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) Operations: \"+1\" and \"Ã—2\"**\n",
    "* **Add 1** (in binary): find the last `0` in the final part, transform it into `1` and set all the following `1`s to `0`. Example: `10100111 + 1 â†’ 10101000`. The Turing machine that does this in expanded binary has **more steps** than in unary, but for large numbers it's **much faster**.\n",
    "* **Multiply by 2**: in expanded binary it becomes even **simpler** than in unary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7) The takeaway idea**\n",
    "* There's a **trade-off**:\n",
    "   * **Unary** = super simple instructions but infinite tape.\n",
    "   * **Expanded binary** = slightly more complex instructions but **much more practical** for large numbers and complex sequences.\n",
    "* With this encoding the Turing machine can read numbers, understand their boundaries, concatenate many of them and even mix **data and commands**. It's the foundation for running **real algorithms** efficiently."
