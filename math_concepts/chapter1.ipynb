    "#### **Introduction to Natural Numbers**\n",
    "Numbers are the basis of modern mathematics. The German mathematician Leopold Kronecker stated: *\"God created the natural numbers, everything else is the work of man\"*. The natural numbers \\(1, 2, 3, ...\\) were born as tools to count objects, without being tied to their specific characteristics.\n",

    "## **The Infinite Number System and the Principle of Mathematical Induction**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **The Infinite Numbers**\n",
    "The natural numbers $(1, 2, 3, 4, ...)$ are infinite because, given any number $(n)$, it is always possible to find the next $(n+1)$. This concept is fundamental in mathematics and extends to many other infinite structures, such as points on a line or triangles in a plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Principle of Mathematical Induction**\n",
    "Mathematical induction is a rigorous method of proving that a property is valid for **all** natural numbers. It is distinguished from empirical induction used in the natural sciences, which is based on limited observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical induction follows two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basis of induction**: It is shown that the property is valid for an initial value, usually $(n=1)$.\n",
    "2. **Inductive step**: We prove that if the property holds for a number $(n)$, then it also holds for $(n+1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If both steps are true, the property holds for all natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 1: Angle Sum of a Polygon**\n",
    "We prove that the sum of the angles of a polygon with $(n+2)$ sides is always $(n \\times 180^\\circ)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base**: For $(n=1)$, a triangle has angle sum $(180^\\circ)$, which is $(1 \\times 180^\\circ)$.\n",
    "2. **Inductive step**: We assume that the formula holds for a polygon with $(n+2)$ sides. If we add a side and divide the polygon with a diagonal, we get two polygons, whose angle sum is $( (n+1) \\times 180^\\circ )$. So the formula is also valid for $(n+1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example 2: Dividing the Plane with $(n)$ Lines**\n",
    "We show that with $(n)$ lines the plane can be divided into maximum $(2n)$ parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basis**: For $(n=1)$, a line divides the plane into 2 parts.\n",
    "2. **Inductive step**: If the formula is valid for $(n)$, adding a line can divide any pre-existing region into two parts, so the maximum number of regions becomes $(2(n+1))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation in Python with NumPy**\n",
    "Now let's implement the principle of induction in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Checking the Sum of Angles of a Polygon**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "def sum_of_angles(n):\n",
    "return n * 180 # Formula for the sum of angles of a polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test for the first values ​​of n\n",
    "angles = np.array([sum_of_angles(n) for n in range(1, 6)])\n",
    "print(\"Sum of angles for polygons with 3-7 sides:\", angles)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Checking the Division of the Plane with $(n)$ Lines**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def max_regions(n):\n",
    "return 2 * n # Derived formula for the maximum number of regions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test for the first values ​​of n\n",
    "regions = np.array([max_regions(n) for n in range(1, 6)])\n",
    "print(\"Maximum number of regions with 1-5 lines:\", regions)\n",
    "```\n",

    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "Mathematical induction is a powerful method for proving propositions that hold for all natural numbers. With Python and NumPy, we can explore these concepts computationally and empirically."
