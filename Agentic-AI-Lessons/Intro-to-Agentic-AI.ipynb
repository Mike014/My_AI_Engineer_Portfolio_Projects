    "It is the set of methods and principles that allow an AI to go beyond static workflows, assuming **autonomy**: it plans, makes decisions, acts, and adapts to obstacles.\n",

    "Key difference: from a tool that executes instructions → to a collaborator who achieves goals.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **LLM Workflows**: predetermined and repeatable pipelines (e.g., support chatbots). They are predictable, testable, and often cheaper and more reliable than complex agents.\n",
    "2. **Single-Agent Systems**: one agent assesses the situation, chooses tools, and adapts (OODA loop: *Observe, Orient, Decide, Act*).\n",
    "3. **Multi-Agent Systems**: multiple agents collaborate with centralized (supervisor) or decentralized (peer-to-peer) models, tackling complex problems.\n",

    "* **Tools** – The Hands\n",
    "\n",
    "They allow action in the external world: database queries, APIs, web searches, calculations. They make the agent a \"doer\" as well as a \"talker.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "     * **Short-Term**: Maintains consistency throughout a session.\n",
    "     * **Long-Term**: Remembers persistent information (preferences, past questions).\n",

    "* **Refinement**\n",
    "Iterating, critiquing, and improving responses (e.g., Reflection, self-critique).\n",
