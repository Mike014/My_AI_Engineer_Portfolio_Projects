# Types of Learning in Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning
- **Characteristic**: The network is trained on labeled data
- **Process**: Associates specific inputs with correct outputs
- **Example**: Classification of photos into "cat" or "dog"

## Unsupervised Learning
- **Characteristic**: No labels in the data
- **Process**: Autonomously identifies structures in data
- **Techniques**: Clustering, dimensionality reduction (PCA, autoencoder)
- **Example**: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behaviors

## Reinforcement Learning
- **Characteristic**: Interaction with an environment
- **Process**: The agent receives rewards or penalties based on actions
- **Example**: Robot learning to navigate while avoiding obstacles

## Learning with Few Examples

### Few-shot Learning
- **Characteristic**: 2-10 examples per class
- **Techniques**: Meta-learning, external memory
- **Example**: Recognizing a new animal species from 5 images

### One-shot Learning
- **Characteristic**: Only one example per class
- **Process**: Immediate generalization from a single example
- **Techniques**: Neural networks with external memory (NTM)
- **Example**: Facial recognition from a single photo

### Zero-shot Learning
- **Characteristic**: No direct examples
- **Process**: Recognition based on textual descriptions
- **Example**: Identifying a zebra from the description "animal with black and white stripes"
