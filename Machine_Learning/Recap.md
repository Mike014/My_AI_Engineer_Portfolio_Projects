# Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

## Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, models are trained using **labeled datasets**, where each input is associated with a known output. The objective is to learn a mapping from inputs (X) to outputs (Y).

**Main Categories:**

### Classification
Predicts **discrete classes** (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

- **Examples:**
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forests
  - Naive Bayes
  - Neural Networks

### Regression
Predicts **continuous values** (e.g., housing prices).

- **Examples:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - Neural Networks

## Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning, models work with **unlabeled data**, aiming to uncover hidden patterns without explicit instructions.

**Main Techniques:**

### Clustering
Groups data based on similarity.

- **Examples:**
  - K-Means
  - DBSCAN
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

### Dimensionality Reduction
Reduces the number of features while preserving data variance.

- **Examples:**
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Autoencoders

## Summary
- **Supervised Learning:** Utilizes labeled data for tasks like classification and regression.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Explores unlabeled data to identify patterns, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction.

Understanding these distinctions is fundamental in selecting the appropriate machine learning approach for a given problem.

* **Supervised** → With labels → **Classification & Regression**
* **Unsupervised** → Without labels → **Clustering & Pattern Discovery, Latent Representation Learning**
