    "A **class of generative machine learning models** that produce **high-quality synthetic data**.\n",
    "These models work by gradually **transforming a noisy initial sample** through a **series of passes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diffusion models work by defining two processes**: a **forward process that adds noise** to the data, and a **reverse process that learns to remove the noise** step by step to **reconstruct the original data**. This mechanism allows for the generation of **high-quality samples from random noise**.\n",

    "- **Synthetic data**: This is **data that is artificially generated by the model**, not from real measurements or observations.\n",
    "- **Noise**: In the scattering process, noise is a **random disturbance added to the data**"
