    "## **What is Q-learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q-learning** is a **reinforcement learning algorithm** that teaches an agent which action to perform in each state to **maximize cumulative rewards**. It uses the **Q(s, a)** function to estimate the expected value of an action in a state, updated via the **Bellman equation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In complex environments, the Q-table is replaced by a **neural network (Q-network)** built with **Keras**. The network has:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Input**: state\n",
    "* **Output**: possible actions\n",
    "* **Hidden layer with ReLU activation**, output with linear activation\n",
    "\n",
    "Training occurs in a loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **agent explores** the environment using an **ε-greedy policy**.\n",
    "2. It **executes actions**, receives rewards, updates the network.\n",
    "3. ε (exploration) decreases over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, the agent is evaluated using the **learned policy** to maximize rewards. OpenAI Gym’s CartPole environment is used as an example."
