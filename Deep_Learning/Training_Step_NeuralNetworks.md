### **Neural Network Training Process**  

**The key concept is continuous iteration** to improve the model until it reaches an acceptable error level.  

1️⃣ **Forward Propagation**  
   - Data is fed through the network.  
   - Weights and biases determine the network’s output.  
   - The network generates a prediction.  

2️⃣ **Error Calculation**  
   - The network’s output is compared to the actual value (**ground truth**).  
   - The error is computed using a cost function.  

3️⃣ **Backward Propagation**  
   - The error is propagated backward through the network.  
   - The gradient (derivative of the cost function) is calculated.  
   - Weights and biases are updated using **gradient descent**.  

4️⃣ **Iteration**  
   - The cycle **Forward → Error → Backward → Update** is repeated.  
   - This continues for a certain number of **epochs** or until the error is sufficiently small.  

5️⃣ **Target Achieved**  
   - When the error reaches its minimum, the model is ready to make accurate predictions!  

## **Neural network training (for Dummies) is an iterative process aimed at minimizing prediction errors. It consists of**:

**Imagine wanting to teach a child to recognize apples**. At first, the child doesn't know what an apple is, so you show them various images of apples and say, "This is an apple."

**Forward Propagation:**

* The child looks at the image of the apple.
* The apple images are the input data.
* The child's response is the output.

**Error Calculation:**

* You compare the child's response with the correct answer ("Yes, it's an apple"). If the child says "No," there is an error.
* In a complete training scenario, you would have a "ground truth" (the correct answer) to compare with the output.
* A "cost function" would calculate how wrong the model's answer is.

**Backward Propagation:**

* You explain why their answer was wrong and give them tips on how to improve (e.g., "Apples are round and red").
* Backpropagation calculates the "gradient" (how much each weight and bias contributed to the error).
* "Gradient descent" is a method to update the weights and biases to reduce the error.

**Iteration:**

* You repeat the process, showing more images of apples and correcting the errors.
* You repeat steps 1-3 multiple times (this is an "epoch").

**Target Achieved:**

* The child correctly recognizes apples.
* The neural network is trained and can make accurate predictions.

In summary, it is an **iterative process** where each cycle improves the model until we achieve an **output close to reality**.
