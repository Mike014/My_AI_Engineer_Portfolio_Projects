    "## Custom Training Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A **custom training loop** gives you full control over the training process. It consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A dataset\n",
    "* A model\n",
    "* An optimizer\n",
    "* A loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "You iterate over the dataset, compute the loss, calculate gradients, and apply them to update the model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use of **custom loss functions** and **custom metrics**\n",
    "* Enhanced **logging and monitoring**\n",
    "* Greater **flexibility for research**\n",
    "* Seamless integration of **custom operations** and **custom layers**\n",

    "\n",
    "[Keras Tuner](https://keras.io/keras_tuner/) is a library designed to **automate hyperparameter tuning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the model with tunable hyperparameters\n",
    "2. Configure the search space\n",
    "3. Run the search process\n",
    "4. Analyze the results\n",
    "5. Train the model with the best hyperparameters\n",
