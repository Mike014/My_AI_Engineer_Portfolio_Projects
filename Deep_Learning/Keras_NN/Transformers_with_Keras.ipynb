    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "### **Problem to Solve**\n",
    "Language models like **DialoGPT** are highly effective in generating conversations but suffer from a well-known issue called **Catastrophic Forgetting**. This occurs when a model, after being fine-tuned on a new dataset, **completely forgets previously learned information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective of the Experiment**\n",
    "This experiment aims to **test the use of Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) on DialoGPT** to:\n",
    "1. **Retain memory** of key information (e.g., favorite color).\n",
    "2. **Prevent Catastrophic Forgetting** after fine-tuning.\n",
    "3. **Stabilize learning** without compromising the model’s ability to generate responses.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Method**\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, we followed these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loaded the pre-trained DialoGPT model.**\n",
    "2. **Created a customized dataset** with questions and answers to test memory retention.\n",
    "3. **Implemented the EWC penalty,** computing the Fisher Information Matrix to protect critical weights.\n",
    "4. **Fine-tuned the model** for 10 epochs using the EWC penalty.\n",
    "5. **Tested the model with a set of questions** to evaluate response consistency after training.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "* The experiment demonstrated that EWC helps retain memory in the model.\n",
    "* The model remembers \"blue\" as its favorite color even after fine-tuning.\n",
    "* Catastrophic Forgetting has been significantly reduced.\n",
    "* The model still generates fragmented and incoherent sentences, suggesting EWC might need further balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your intuition was correct: EWC can be used as a hybrid approach to stabilize memory in LLMs.\n",
    "* The model successfully retains key information while continuing to generate responses.\n",
    "* However, optimizing EWC further is necessary to improve coherence and fluency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "* Fine-tune the dataset to balance knowledge retention and response quality.\n",
    "* Further adjust the EWC penalty to prevent rigid responses.\n",
    "* Optimize generation parameters (`temperature`, `top_k`, etc.) for better coherence.\n",
    "\n",
